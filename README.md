# Words App

Words app contains a scrollable list of 26 letters A to Z in a RecyclerView. The orientation
of the RecyclerView can be changed between a vertical list or a grid of items. This in terms of functionality is almost identical to the other Words_Application repository, the main difference in terms of the code is that fragments are used instead of navigating between activities using Intents. The application also uses Preference DataStore so that the user's selection for either grid or list view for the alphabets are saved when the application is relaunched.
